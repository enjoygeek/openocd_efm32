Programming:
1. Open a terminal
2. change directory to openocd_efm32/openocd-0.8.0/bin-x64
3. type "openocd-x64-0.8.0.exe -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/efm32_stlink.cfg"
4. open a second terminal
5. type "arm-gdb.exe"
6. type "target remote localhost:3333
   now all openocd command are availlable with "monitor" before!
7. type "monitor poll"
	this should give you 
	"background polling: on"
	"TAP: efm32.cpu <enabled>"
	"target state: running"
8. type "monitor reset"
	this should reset your device
9. type "monitor reset halt"
	this should reset and halt your device
10. type "program 01_LCD_Example_basic.bin"
	this should program your device
	"target state:halted"
	"target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread"
	"xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x00000204 msp: 0x20000428"
	"** Programming Started **"
	"target state:halted"
	"target halted due to breakpoint, current mode: Thread"
	"xPSR: 0x061000000 pc: 0x100000056 msp: 0x20000428"
	
	then I always lost the communication between openocd and the target...
	After doing Nr. 3-6 again you should be able to start your program 
	with "monitor reset"
	
Debuging:
=> first do the programming!
1. Open a terminal
2. change directory to openocd_efm32/openocd-0.8.0/bin-x64
3. type "openocd-x64-0.8.0.exe -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/efm32_stlink.cfg"
4. open a second terminal
5. type "arm-gdb.exe Basic_Example_EFM32G880F128-STK_EmBlocks.elf"
6. type "target remote localhost:3333
   now all openocd command are availlable with "monitor" before!
7. type "monitor reset halt"
   this should reset and halt your device
8. type "s" to step forward in your program
9. you could also type "finish"
10. or type "next 5"
